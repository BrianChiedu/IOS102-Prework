# *IOS102-Prework*

Submitted by: **Brian Chukwuisiocha**

**IOS102-Prework** is an app that displays three labels containing my name, name of my university and dream job position. The app implements a
button that changes the background of the screen when it detects user taps. In addition, in the launchscreen the app implements image views and 
auto-layouts to display my logo and a background image optimally.

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Goodnotes: 
 <ul>
  <li>The writing experience on goodnotes with the apple pencil is by far the most natural and realistic I've ever seen. My pencil floats across
      the screen like it would on paper.</li>
  <li>Instead of having to buy stationaries such as highlighters, sticky notes, erasers and etc. Goodnotes gives me all of them in one app and 
    maintains them in an organized way so I can easily reach for them.</li>
  <li>As a college student, Goodnotes provides an efficient way to store all my notes, pdfs and hand-outs. It brings organization and efficiency to my 
  note-taking.</li>
    </ul>
  
2. iMessages:
 <ul>
  <li>All my devices are apple, and most people in my network use apple. Its seamless integration allows me to easily text any of my friends 
    through any of my apple devices.</li>
  <li>It fulfills its purpose really well and doesn't have unecessary extra features unlike other messaging apps such as snapchat. The user 
    experience is really top class.</li>
  </ul>
  
3. Shop:
  <ul>
  <li>My favorite feature is that it provides me a single app to track all my orders instead of having to track by looking through multiple order emails.</li>
  <li>Shop also keeps me up to date with the status of my order. Through its notifications I can easily monitor when my order has been shipped 
    and delivered.</li>
  <li>In addition, they integrate well with ecommerce shops and this makes my checkouts at these websites much more faster and easier.</li>
  </ul>
  
## An app I would like to build
Public Transportation Network App: It would display various modes of public transportation, their scheduled times, scheduled stops as well as 
the prices of each mode. My target audience would be for my home country, Nigeria, and for Africa as a whole. Its route suggestions and 
traffic predictions would be optimized to African roads as we have a distinct transportation network. Africa has a large untapped tech sector 
and this app would provide a solution to a common problem Nigerians face when trying to go about their daily endeavors.
